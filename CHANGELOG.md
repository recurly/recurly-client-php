### Upgrade Notes
1. If you are using the `Recurly_ExportFile` class, you must now use `getDownloadUrl()` to get the download url rather than accessing this property directly.
```php
# if you are accessing the download url directly
$url = $export_file->download_url;
# you'll now need to use a getter
$url = $export_file->getDownloadUrl();
```
If you are using `$export_file->download($fp)` and not accessing the url directly, you should not be affected.

2. If your test environment changes the `Recurly_Client::$apiUrl` property, it will no longer work due to domain whitelisting. For a workaround, please see [this conversation](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/408#discussion_r274063679).

### Upgrade Notes

There are several breaking changes to support the new credit memos feature.

#### 1. InvoiceCollection

When creating invoices or using `markFailed()`, we now return an `Recurly_InvoiceCollection` object rather than an `Recurly_Invoice`. If you wish to upgrade your application without changing functionality, we recommend that you use the `charge_invoice` on the `Recurly_InvoiceCollection`. Example:

```php
# Change This:
$invoice = Recurly_Invoice::invoicePendingCharges('my_account_code');

# To this
$invoiceCollection = Recurly_Invoice::invoicePendingCharges('my_account_code');
$invoice = $invoiceCollection->charge_invoice;
```

Calls that now return `InvoiceCollection` instead of `Invoice`:

* `Recurly_Purchase::invoice()`
* `Recurly_Purchase::preview()`
* `Recurly_Purchase::authorize()`
* `Recurly_Invoice::invoicePendingCharges()`
* `Recurly_Invoice::previewPendingCharges()`

Furthermore, `Recurly_Invoice->markFailed()` no longer updates the invoice but rather returns a new `Recurly_InvoiceCollection` object:

```php
# Change This:
$invoice->markFailed();

# To this
$invoiceCollection = $invoice->markFailed();
$failedInvoice = $invoiceCollection->charge_invoice;
```

#### 2. Recurly_Invoice->original_invoice removed

`Recurly_Invoice->original_invoice` was removed in favor of `Recurly_Invoice->original_invoices`. If you want to maintain functionality, change your code grab the first invoice from that endpoint:

```php
# Change this
$originalInvoice = $invoice->original_invoice->get();

# To this
$originalInvoice = $invoice->original_invoices->get()->current(); # current is first item
```

#### 3. Invoice `subtotal_*` changes

We have renamed two of the invoice subtotal fields to more clearly reflect their values:
- Renamed `subtotal_in_cents` to `subtotal_before_discount_in_cents`
- Renamed `subtotal_after_discount_in_cents` to `subtotal_in_cents`

#### 4. Invoice Refund -- `refund_apply_order` changed to `refund_method`

If you were using `Recurly_Invoice->refund` or `Recurly_Invoice->refundAmount` and explicitly setting the second `refund_apply_order` parameter, then you may need to change value to fit the new `refund_method` format. The values for this have changed from (`credit`, `transaction`) to (`credit_first`, `transaction_first`)

If you don't explicitly set the `refund_apply_order` like in these two calls, no change is needed:
```php
$invoice->refund($line_items);
$invoice->refundAmount(1000);
```

If you do set the second param, you'll need to change:
* `credit` to `credit_first`
* `transaction` to `transaction_first`

Examples:
```php
# Change `credit`:
$invoice->refund($line_items, 'credit');
$invoice->refundAmount(1000, 'credit');

# To `credit_first`
$invoice->refund($line_items, 'credit_first');
$invoice->refundAmount(1000, 'credit_first');

# Change `transaction`
$invoice->refund($line_items, 'transaction');
$invoice->refundAmount(1000, 'transaction');

# To `transaction_first`
$invoice->refund($line_items, 'transaction_first');
$invoice->refundAmount(1000, 'transaction_first');
```

#### 5. Invoice States

If you are checking `Recurly_Invoice->state` anywhere, you will want to check that you have the new correct values. `collected` has changed to `paid` and `open` has changed to `pending`. Example:

```php
# Change this
if ($invoice->state == 'collected')
# To this
if ($invoice->state == 'paid')
```
```php
# Change this
if ($invoice->state == 'open')
# To this
if ($invoice->state == 'pending')
```

This also affects the `Recurly_InvoiceList::getCollected()` and `Recurly_InvoiceList::getOpen()` functions. Example:

```php
# Change this
Recurly_InvoiceList::getCollected()
# To this
Recurly_InvoiceList::getPaid()
```
```php
# Change this
Recurly_InvoiceList::getOpen()
# To this
Recurly_InvoiceList::getPending()
```

#### 6. Deprecated `Recurly_Invoice->subscription` and `Recurly_Transaction->subscription` removed

If you are using `Recurly_Invoice->subscription` or `Recurly_Transaction->subscription` anywhere, you will now need to call `subscriptions` instead and take the first one.

```php
# Change this
$subscription = $invoice->subscription->get();
# To this
$subscription = $invoice->subscriptions->get()->current();

# Or this
$subscription = $transaction->subscription->get();
# To this
$subscription = $transaction->subscriptions->get()->current();
```

## Version 2.9.0 (October 6th, 2017)

This release will upgrade us to API version 2.8.

- Added custom invoice notes to `Purchase` [#332](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/332)
- Added `imported_trial` boolean field to `Subscription` [#331](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/331)

### Upgrade Notes

There is one breaking changes in this API version you must consider. All `country` fields must now contain valid [2 letter ISO 3166 country codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html).  If your country code fails validation, you will receive a validation error. This affects any endpoint where an address is collected.

## Version 2.8.2 (July 21th, 2017)

* Fixes a bug creating subscriptions for existing accounts (thanks to @g30rg) [#326](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/326)

## Version 2.8.1 (July 14th, 2017)

This bumps us to API v2.7 but does not contain any breaking changes.

* Bump API v2.7 (purchase endpoint updates) [#319](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/319)
* Enhancement: Enable IntelliSense (IDE friendly) for class properties (Part 2) Invoice and Subscription (thanks to @phpdave) [#279](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/279)

## Version 2.8.0 (June 7th, 2017)

No changes from 2.8.0.rc1

## Version 2.8.0.rc1 (June 2nd, 2017)

* Remove 5.3 Support and upgrade Travis to support HHVM [#316](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/316)
* Purchases endpoint [#315](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/315)
* Remove X-Records header [#314](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/314)
* Add trial requires billing info field and no billing info reason field [#312](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/312)

### Upgrade Notes

There are a few breaking changes this release.

1. PHP 5.3 is no longer officially supported and we no longer run tests against it.
2. To speed up your listing requests we're no longer automatically computing the record counts for each request's `X-Records` header. For our larger sites this could halve the response time. If you still need a count it will be computed with a separate request.
From now on, when you call `Recurly_Pager::count()`, it will send a HEAD request to the server. Ensure you aren't calling that method in places where you expect the value
to be cached for you. For more information on how this may affect you, see PR [#314](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php/pull/314)
3. For `POST /v2/subscriptions` Sending `null` for `total_billing_cycles` attribute will now override plan `total_billing_cycles` setting and will make subscription renew forever.
Omitting the attribute will cause the setting to default to the value of plan `total_billing_cycles`.
