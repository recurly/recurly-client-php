# Recurly PHP Client

The Recurly PHP Client library is an open source library to interact with Recurly's subscription management from your PHP website. The library interacts with Recurly's [REST API](http://support.recurly.com/faqs/api).

**Note:** This version uses Recurly API v2. There are substantial differences between this version of the client library and versions before _0.5.0_. Please be careful when upgrading.

## Requirements

The PHP library depends on PHP 5.3.0 (or higher) and libcurl compiled with OpenSSL support. Open up a `phpinfo();` page and verify that under the curl section, there's a line that says something like:

    libcurl/7.19.5 OpenSSL/0.9.8g zlib/1.2.3.3 libidn/1.15

## Installation

### Composer

If you're using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you can simply add a dependency on `recurly/recurly-client` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here's an example of a dependency on 2.1:

    {
        "require": {
            "recurly/recurly-client": "2.1.*"
        }
    }


### Git

If you already have git, the easiest way to download the Recurly PHP Client is with the git command:

    git clone git://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-php.git /path/to/include/recurly

### By Hand

Alternatively, you may download the PHP files in the `lib/` directory and place them within your PHP project.

## Initialization

Load the Recurly library files and set your subdomain and API Key globally:

    <?php
    require_once('./lib/recurly.php');

    Recurly_Client::$subdomain = 'your-subdomain';
    Recurly_Client::$apiKey = '012345678901234567890123456789ab';

If you are using [Recurly.js](http://js.recurly.com), specify your `private_key`:

    Recurly_js::$privateKey = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef";
